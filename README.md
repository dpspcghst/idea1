# ***Zone***

Zone is a puzzle-platform video game with psychological horror elements developed by independent developer Aleksandr Hemingway for the Xbox Series X/S.

## Installing the Prototype

### Dependencies
Zone uses both [Pygame (Community Edition)](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) and [PyTMX](https://github.com/bitcraft/pytmx). You will also need Python, of course. Install both Python packages before running the prototype:
```bash
pip install pygame-ce
pip install pytmx
```

You have the option to either clone my copy:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dpspcghst/zone.git
```

Or fork the game and clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOU_USERNAME]/zone.git
```

Navigate the directory in your terminal, then to `code`, then:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
