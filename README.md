# ***Zone***

Zone is a puzzle-platform video game with psychological horror elements developed by independent developer Aleksandr Hemingway for the Xbox Series X/S.

## Installing the Prototype

You have the option to either clone my copy:
```
git clone https://github.com/dpspcghst/zone.git
```

Or fork the game and clone your fork:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/zone.git
```

### Dependencies
Zone uses both [Pygame (Community Edition)](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) and [PyTMX](https://github.com/bitcraft/pytmx). Install them both before running the prototype:
```
pip install pygame-ce
pip install pytmx
```

You will also need Python, of course. Navigate the directory in your terminal, then to code, then:
```
python3 main.py
```
